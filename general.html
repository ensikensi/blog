                <p id="blogbody"> 
                    this book is actually so good so far. i didnt think it was bad at all but its way better than i thought it was going to be. idk<br>
                    to me it captures the trauma and pain and emotion, its a realistic book, it shows the good and the bad with recovery, its kinda beautiful
                    to read something like that because media loves to portray recovery as an upward line when really its a bunch of ups and downs and it plateus sometimes,
                    its all over the place, and of course everyones recovery <i>is</i> different, but this is just such an accurate depiction of what it is like especially
                    for someone like her, someone who was so deeply hurt and scarred (physically and mentally) and even after the horrid assaults and violence shes been though,
                    she still opens her arms to love because shes able to. not all assault victims immediately become sex-repulsed or celibate, some welcome the safety that comes
                    from that type of love when its with the person who can provide that safety. i dunno<br>
                    its just a good book so far :) im on page 248<br>
                    super good
